## Predicting Prediabetes with BigQuery ML using FHIR and SDOH data
This repo mainly contains a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/hkolasani/FHIR-SDOH-BigQueryML/blob/master/SDOH-ML.ipynb) that builds a [Binary Logistic Regression](https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-binary-logistic-regression-in-r-7d802a9d98fe) model using BIGQueryML to predict diabetes for a population of FHIR patient data that is augmented by SDOH factors such as food and transportation. 

## BigQuery ML and Binary Logistic Regression Model
You can use the binary logistic regression model to predict whether a value falls into one of two categories. A common problem in machine learning is to classify data into one of two types, known as labels. In this case, we may want to predict whether a given patient will be prediabetic or not , based on other information about that patient. The two labels will be "prediabetic" and "not prediabetic".  The input dataset needs to be built such that one column represents the label. 

[Google's BigQuery ML](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/bigqueryml-intro) enables users to create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery using standard SQL queries. BigQuery ML supports supervised learningâ€Š with the [logistic regression](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#model_type) model type.

## Patient Data - Synthea FHIR 
The primary dataset that's used in this exercise is from [Synthea Synthetic Patient FHIR data](https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/) which contains around ~1M Patient resources and their related Conditions and Observations. This data is available in BigQuery as a public data set. 

The Patient data is joined with Conditions data to append the column "prediabetic" (true/false) along with Patient's age, sex, rece, marital status and zip.
```
SELECT 
      IFNULL(P.address[SAFE_OFFSET(0)].postalCode, "") AS zip,
	  sdohml.calculateAge(PARSE_DATE('%Y-%m-%d',  P.birthDate)) age, 
      P.gender sex,
      P.us_core_race.text.value.string race,
      P.maritalStatus.coding[SAFE_OFFSET(0)].code maritalStatus,
      sdohml.prediabeticcheck(coding.code) prediabetic
FROM 
      bigquery-public-data.fhir_synthea.condition  C, 
      UNNEST(C.code.coding) coding
JOIN 
      bigquery-public-data.fhir_synthea.patient P
ON 
      C.subject.patientId = P.id
WHERE 
      C.verificationstatus = 'confirmed' AND
      coding.system = 'http://snomed.info/sct'
```
## SDOH Data
Conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play affect a wide range of health risks and outcomes. These conditions are known as social determinants of health (SDOH). 

Along with patient data like age, race, marital status, we'll be using SDOH factors like employment, food insecurity and transportation as some of features for predicting prediabetes. Ideally, the SDOH risk factors are compiled by collecting this information from the patient and associate them with their record. [The Gravity Project](https://www.hl7.org/gravity/) is building an interoperable data standard based on HL7 FHIR for representing SDOH related data for screening, diagnosis, planning, and interventions.  The process of generating SDOH data as FHIR resources involves, Generating a FHIR Questionnaire for a specific LOINC panel like [Money and resources [PRAPARE]](https://loinc.org/93041-2/) and use the QuestionnaireResponse to build an Observation:

```
{
    "resourceType": "Observation",
    "code": {
        "coding": [
            {
                "code": "82589-3",
                "display": "Highest level of education",
                "system": "http://loinc.org"
            }
        ],
        "text": "Highest level of education"
    },
    "status": "final",
    "subject": {
        "reference": "Patient/6f7acde5-db81-4361-82cf-886893a3280c"
    },
    "valueCodeableConcept": {
        "coding": [
            {
                "code": "LA38-5",
                "display": "High school",
                "system": "http://loinc.org"
            }
        ],
        "text": "High school"
    }
}
```
For now, we'll just generate random responses to [Money and resources [PRAPARE]](https://loinc.org/93041-2/)  questions and bypass the creation of Observations and just append the answers/observations to out Patient data. The following view is used for generating random responses for the questions. Ideally this data should come from the Observations that were created based on the QuestionnaireResponses. 
```

*The end goal in this data prep is to have a single Patient record that contains the demographics data like age, race, sex and the SDOH factors. The LOINC code for the question like [93031-3](https://loinc.org/93031-3/) will be used as a column name and the answer/observation_value_code like 'LA30125-1' will be used as the column value on the Patient record.* . If you really want to build the data the real way, you can use this [Form Builder for FHIR Questionnaire](https://lhcformbuilder.nlm.nih.gov/) that generates Questionnaire for LOINC panels like [Money and resources [PRAPARE]](https://loinc.org/93041-2/).
